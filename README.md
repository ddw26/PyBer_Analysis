# PyBer_Analysis

## OBJECTIVE ##
I was hired as a data analyst for PyBer- a python based ride sharing application. Pyber tasked me with completing an exploratory analysis and visualization over large data sets. My exploratory analysis allowed Pyber to improve rider accessibility and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
