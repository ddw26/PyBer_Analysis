# PyBer_Analysis

## OBJECTIVE ##
I was intially hired as a data analyst for PyBer- a python based ride sharing application. Pyber tasked me and Omary with submitting an exploratory analysis and visualization over large data sets. My exploratory analysis allowed Pyber to improve rider accessibility and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Once completed, V. Isualize gave us a new assignment: to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, utilize Pandas and Matplotlib to display a multiple-line graph. The multi line graph must  the total weekly fares per city.
