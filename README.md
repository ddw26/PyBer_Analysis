# PyBer_Analysis

## OBJECTIVE ##
I was intially hired as a data analyst for PyBer- a python based ride sharing application. Pyber tasked me and Omar with submitting an exploratory analysis and visualization over large data sets. My exploratory analysis allowed Pyber to improve rider accessibility, and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Once completed, V. Isualize gave us a new assignment: to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib as means to display a multiple-line graph. The multi line graph shows the total fares per city, and I extrapolate on how the data differs per city.


## RESULTS ##

The Pyber Summary DataFrame focuses on city type (urban, suburban, rural) in relation to average fares, total drivers, and rides. Pyber saw most of it's profitability from urban areas- an expected calculation considering that urban areas are densely populated, which means more drivers, more riders, and lower fares. Shockingly, driver count for suburban areas take a sharp decrease versus its urban counterpart; from 2,405 to 490. Rural riders and drivers are relatively low in correlation to each other, however the avg fare per driver in rural areas is over half the cost for urban areas.

Furthermore, the multi-line graph above showcases total fares by city types from the months of January to April. Urban areas saw their highest profit peaks into & throughout March, platauing relatively high into April. I infer that this is because densely populated areas may have more spring festivities taking place. The same can be said for suburban and rural areas as their fares also peak into March- however they both taper back downward. The main difference is that suburban areas spike into the end of April, almost surpassing urban numbers. This may be due to the fact that suburban populations are more willing to go out going in warmer months, teens and working young adults are on spring break, etc.


## PYBER SUMMARY

Based on the results, I propose that PyBer can make a few adaptation in the operations department to increase revenue in suburban and rural areas. Here are my suggestions: 
- Though suburbs are slightly farther out (distance) than urban areas, it may be profitable to incentivize urban drivers who are willing to drive out into the suburbs to increase the number of drivers in that area. Doing so will lower ride fares for suburban populations, and encourage them to take more rides.
- The number of drivers in rural areas are massively low. However from my personal observation, rural populations tend to have more vehicles. It may be in Pyber's best interest to market for more rural drivers (especially because rural driver fares are very high). Make it a point that rural drivers can make more money due to their geolocation (they can also drive into the suburbs). Increasing the number of rural drivers can lower ride fares for rural populations, and increase driver counts in suburban populations for those willing to take the ride.
